TITLE: NEW BOOK ENDPOINT AND MODEL IN SYSTEM

AS A User in the library system
I WANT TO add new books, find all books that are available, filter books by their title
SO THAT I can use them for my private library

How the book model should look like:

BookModel {
    title: string,
    author: string,
    category: string,
    genre: string,
    year_issued: number
    pages: number
}
